		Abstractâ€”This study presents a Machine Learning (ML)
		approach to learn streamflow dynamics in the Upper Colorado
		River Basin (UCRB). Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
		statistical emulators are used to predict daily streamflow across a
		range of hydrologic conditions for five headwater streams in the
		UCRB. First, we assess how well specialized LSTM models trained
		on only one stream perform on out-of-sample testing datasets that
		come from the same stream. Then, we explore how well the
		specialized models transfer to test datasets that come from other
		streams. Finally, we compare the performance of the specialized
		cases to a generalized LSTM model that is trained on all
		headwater streams together. We find that the best overall
		performances come from the specialized LSTM models tested on
		the same domains upon which they were tested. However, in some
		situations models trained on other domains perform best -
		particularly when predicting outlier (very high and very low flow)
		conditions. Our results are an important test case in showing how
		transfer learning from novel data-driven approaches, like LSTM,
		can be used to make hydrologically relevant predictions.)
